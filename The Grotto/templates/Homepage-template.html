    <p><small class="text-muted">A scheme for the distribution of prizes by lot or chance, especially a gaming scheme in which one or
        more tickets bearing particular numbers draw prizes, the other tickets are blanks.

    <p>
        Odds of winning the lottery are woeful and staggering, and yet despite the improbability millions play and players win millions.

        <i>Don't they know how idiotic buying lotto tickets is? Don't they know they are just throwing their money away? "It is a stupidity tax."</i> ~ some Wall-Street Banker once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though crudely expressed, that banker has a point - spending money on lotto tickets is rarely mathematically rational. 
        The odds of winning the lotto are so badly weighted against purchasing a ticket it can be thought as throwing money away. 
        The real value of a $1 purchase is often as low as 32 cents, with the rest of the cost going straight into the profits of the ticket sellers. 
        Those huge profit margins are why governments have increasingly turned to lotteries to raise funds, rather than through direct tax increases.
